Music has been part of my life since childhood, shaped by a family that celebrated it during holidays and long car rides from Dinwiddie to Richmond, soaking in the sounds of the late ’90s and early 2000s. In sixth grade, my sister introduced me to writing and freestyling—a skill passed down from our friend Brandon Cole (RIP)—and I began freestyling with friends. My neighbors, the Hardy family, also influenced me with their gospel music and live instrumentation. After my mother passed in 2008, I moved to Richmond and used music as an emotional outlet, inspired by artists like J. Cole, Lil Wayne, and Biggie. By 2011, I was crafting my own bars, and after moving to North Carolina in 2014, I focused heavily on my craft—mastering song structure, rhythmic flow, and originality. That same year, my cousin 4thG3ar and I formed Cold Connect, a collaborative group dedicated to connecting dope creatives and pushing lyrical and production boundaries.

From there, 4thG3ar and I recorded across NC and VA, building a catalog that led to my 2022 debut EP Just Ju! and my 2023 album Ode to Richmond—a 17-track tribute to my roots. A week after its release, I moved to Denver for new opportunities and linked up with my brother, now my manager. I began performing regularly at open mics and jam sessions like Beats Bodega and Meadowlark, networking with passionate artists and producers. By early 2025, momentum was building—more shows, more connections, and a creative environment that feels like life is finally on the rise.
