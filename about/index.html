                Music has been part of my life since childhood, shaped by a
                family that celebrated it during holidays and long car rides
                from Dinwiddie to Richmond, soaking in the sounds of the late
                '90s and early 2000s. In sixth grade, my sister introduced me to
                writing and freestyling—a skill passed down from our friend
                Brandon Cole (RIP)—and I began freestyling with friends. My
                neighbors, the Hardy family, also influenced me with their
                gospel music and live instrumentation. After my mother passed in
                2008, I moved to Richmond and used music as an emotional outlet,
                inspired by artists like J. Cole, Lil Wayne, and Biggie. By
                2011, I was crafting my own bars, and after moving to North
                Carolina in 2014, I focused heavily on my craft—mastering song
                structure, rhythmic flow, and originality. That same year, my
                cousin 4thG3ar and I formed Cold Connect, a collaborative group
                dedicated to connecting dope creatives and pushing lyrical and
                production boundaries.

                From there, 4thG3ar and I recorded across NC and VA, building a
                catalog that led to my 2022 debut EP Just Ju! and my 2023 album
                Ode to Richmond—a 17-track tribute to my roots. A week after its
                release, I moved to Denver for new opportunities and linked up
                with my brother, now my manager. I began performing regularly at
                open mics and jam sessions like Beats Bodega and Meadowlark,
                networking with passionate artists and producers. Using these
                connections I linked up with my homie Rian or deuce and co
                founded Home Team. A collective of not only artists but
                videographers, photographers, and other creators that fit the
                brand. While still a work in progress we focus is currently on
                the starting 5: @Kree23, @Rian or duece, @Bojack Carter, @Villy
                V, and myself. Supported by DJ/Producer @facedefeat to provide a
                musical experience like no other, stay tuned!
